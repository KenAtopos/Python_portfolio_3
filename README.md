# Tic Tac Toe Game

## This is a simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python. The game is played by two players, who take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 board. The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all the squares on the board are filled but no player has won, the game is a tie.
